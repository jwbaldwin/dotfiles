# dotfiles
My dotfiles, tracked in a bare git repository. No fuss, no special sauce.

Technique borrowed from [Nicola Paolucci's blog post](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles) and [Derrick Reimer](https://github.com/derrickreimer/dotfiles).

## Intial setup

## New workstation setup
-- I should get around to documenting this, but it's in the resources above too
